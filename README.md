Fate System Dice Roller For Android
===================================

This app **is for android only**. It can be used when roleplaying with the Fate 
System rules.

- Usage    
It's pretty straightforward. Just click on the skill number and the app will 
automatically throw four fate dice for you, add the the resulting value to the 
skill and show the total at the bottom. Four images will show the result of each
 die. An arrow will graphically show if the dice total was good or bad, so that 
 it can help the gamer roleplay the situation accordingly.

- Version    
The actual version is 0.1. Still a beta and still a work in progress.

- Status    
This app still does not reach a stable version but it is 
functional and can be used without problems.

- Testing    
The app has been tested on a Samsung Wonder only (personal use).
